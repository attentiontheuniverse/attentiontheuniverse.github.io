goodnight, my beautiful human
change the world each day of your life.
breathe the air of wrongdoing only when you must,
but most certainly no less.
allow no corner of the globe to exist in darkness
but allow yourself to trust others to help.

spend nights where the inky blackness dies only when our mother wills it
and look up at our brother whenever you can.
your family is much wider than you could ever hope to know
and your lover is so much more than you've yet found out.

the grass commands you to lie and the rocks implore you to sit
but the walls welcome you in and the lights guide you to safety.
deny neither their requests, only people who befriend both live as they should.

the harsh blue glow wanes now
the warm yellow is suddenly no more
you turn
once
twice
a million

and your mind is gone.
