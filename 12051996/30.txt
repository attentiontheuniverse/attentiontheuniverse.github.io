the apparition turned in the capacity that a dimensionless being can turn
and he spoke in the capacity that such a being can speak
and he said
"i am orion
and i am here neither to protect nor harm
only to observe"

he spoke in a disjointed fashion
he had no lips or tounge to stumble over
and yet he acted as if he did
this was an affront to the fleshy humans he had descended upon
emulating their common heratige of skin and musculature, bone and sinew

the apparition chose his name from  the consciousness of the observer
plucked from the middle of their mind
it meant nothing
he was no hunter
he was nothing

if it were not for the subtle influence on the humans he would have been imperceptible
and he stayed around for only as long as it took for the humans to notice someone had spoke









"what was that?"
