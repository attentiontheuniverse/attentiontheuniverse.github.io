please don't call this project pretentious. the exact reason i'm anonymously putting this stuff on the internet is so that i don't have to be pretentious in real life. it would be pretentious to expect people to take note or think any of this is any good, but it's not pretentious to just make it freely available on a hidden little corner of the internet.
