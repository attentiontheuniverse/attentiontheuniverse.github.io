found the old camcorder from my childhood last night

there are some empty tapes and some full ones

it's really odd to watch yourself as a kid through the eyes of your parents

it's a blessing to see more of things you can only vaguely remember

but it's a curse as the videos and photos replace what organic memories you did have

so now you just remember the photos and not the time itself

its absolutely terrifying to know that you're slowly forgetting you own life

i will never be able to know everything about myself, let alone other people

there is already information that has disappeared into entropy

the universe doesn't care about the difference between signal and noise

why should we

why should we

why should we?

we do anyway and that's the important part

we do anyway and that's the important part

we do anyway and that's the important part.

...



the blank tapes are kinda cool though and the battery still holds half a charge. good potential.
